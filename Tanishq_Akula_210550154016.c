/*
		Algorithm
1. Create two processes using fork().
2. Create a file.txt. Then using buffer compare file with dictionary for words starting with m.
3. Scan the file and print it in file2.txt under process 2 of the second process using pipes.
4. Find the length of string using strlen in file2.txt
5. close all the files.
